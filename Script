[INTRO - SCENE 01]
(Zoom meeting in progress. The atmosphere is casual and friendly.)

Dylen: Halloween is just around the corner, guys. I can't wait for all the spooky decorations and costumes.
Sahan: Yeah, Halloween is the best. It's the one time of year where you can be anyone or anything you want.
Suranjith: I love it, too. And the best part is, you get to choose: trick or treat!
Sanidi: It's all fun and games until you encounter something genuinely terrifying. 
Dylen:Have any of you heard about that reaper story?

Sanidi: What reaper story?
Sahan: Yeah, I remember hearing something about it last year. People went missing or something, right?
Suranjith: I vaguely remember. It gave me the creeps.
Dylen: Haha, come on, guys. Those are just urban legends. People make up all sorts of things to get attention.
Sanidi: I'm not so sure. Sometimes, reality can be scarier than fiction. It's best not to mess with things we don't understand.
Dylen: Stop being so superstitious, Sanidi. By the way, I was searching about it online and found a website to register for some game called the reaper. I thought it could be fun, so I registered us.

Suranjith: Are you serious? Did you give them our personal information?
Dylen: No, just our names and emails addresses. They didn't ask for anything else.

[SCENE 02 - Reaper Joins, the GAME starts]
(Unexpectedly, a person named "The Reaper" joins the Zoom meeting.)

The Reaper: Hello and welcome to The Reaper.

Sanidi: (Concerned) Dylen, is this a joke? Please tell me it's you.

(The others express their concern, and Dylen denies being the mysterious "Reaper.")

Suranjith: Everyone, let's not panic. If it's not one of us, who is it? Did anyone share the meeting link with someone else?
Everyone: No, we didn't.

Dylen: (Addressing the mysterious "Reaper") Who are you?

The Reaper: (Laughs creepily)

[Scene 03 - Demise of Dylen]
(Suddenly, there are three loud knocks on Dylen's door, startling everyone.)

Voice Behind the Door: Trick or treat.

(Someone suggests giving candy to the trick-or-treaters, and Dylen leaves the camera to get the candy.)

Dylen: I've got a bowl of candy right here. Be right back.

(When Dylen opens the door, he encounters a suspicious figure.)

Dylen: (Helpless) Guys... (He turns toward the camera and disconnects.)

[Scene 04 - Demise of Sahan]
Sahan: I knew it was Dylen. He's trying to scare us. We know it's you.

Suranjith: Sahan, are you serious? Didn't you see what happened?

Sahan: What are you talking about?

Sanidi: (Terrified) Dylen, this is not a joke. You're scaring all of us.

(Suddenly, Sahan's video flickers, and two red eyes appear in his window.)

Suranjith: Sahan, something is outside your window!

Sahan: (Looks back but sees nothing) Come on, guys. This has to be a prank, right?

(They hear a wolf howling, followed by sounds of struggle.)

[Scene 05 - Sanidi's Demise]
Sanidi: (Terrified) WEREWOLF! WEREWOLF!!

Suranjith: Sanidi, calm down!

(Sanidi is frightened and barely coherent.)

Sanidi: (Lights go out, and fluttering sounds are heard. When the lights come back on, Sanidi has fallen to the ground.)

Suranjith: What happened to Sanidi?

Sanidi: (Touches the side of her neck, her hand covered in blood) I feel so cold... (falls with a thud.)

[Scene 06 - Promoting Suranjith to the Reaper]
The Reaper: (Turns on the camera, revealing a dark room and a distorted face) Hello, Suranjith. Thank you for being part of our game. If you want to live, you will await our instructions. We will see you next year.

(The Zoom meeting ends with a spine-chilling aura, leaving the audience in suspense and fear.)


In our twisted game 
you play your part,

To stay alive, 
follow with  heart.

Instructions will come, 
in shadows we'll steer

Next halloween, 
the game continues, 

You shall dwell 
in death and fear.

Screen blackens saying and then there were none
